In an attempt to allow this to become a collaborative site for developers, I have followed the instructions [here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-website).

This will allow [GH pages](https://pages.github.com/) to create a web page.

Because I think it is important to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to create the content, I think it should also use [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). Thanks to [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15044353/github-pages-how-do-i-edit-this-page-in-markdown-format-just-as-i-created-it) for the discussion.
